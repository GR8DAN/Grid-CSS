# Grid CSS

An old skool Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for a responsive HTML grid arrangement web page.

The responsive CSS code in the style sheet _grid.css_ is suitable for laying out a web page with columns, headers and footers that is mobile friendly. It is a mobile responsive CSS and friendly to older browser versions (hence old skool). This is because it only uses the older CSS 2 and not the grid module features from CSS 3.

For more information try the Grid CSS test HTML file and browse its HTML code, and look at the article [Grid CSS Old Skool](https://tekeye.uk/html/grid-css-old-skool "A Grid CSS supporting older browsers").
